# Online Portfolio

### Version 1.0

Designed and implemented over the weekend. The objective is to acquire knowledge of the latest front-end JavaScript framework.

**Tools and Frameworks:**

- React
- Material UI
- Figma
- VS Code

**Some useful VS Code Extensions:**

- ESLint (_create-react-app default_)
- Prettier
- Debugger for Chrome

\
**Color Palette Selection**

- [Coolers](https://coolors.co/)
- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/)
- Pinterest for Design Ideas.

\
**Thid Party NPM Libraries**

- React Vertical Timeline by [Stephane Monnot](https://github.com/stephane-monnot/react-vertical-timeline)
- React Parallax Scrolling by [Richard Rutsche](https://github.com/rrutsche/react-parallax)

\
**Future Work**

- [ ] ESLint and/or Prettier integration in future portfolio
- [ ] Further research on responsiveness best practices, e.g. images, typography etc.

Initial research was conducted before selecting which framework to use, e.g. size and load times, learning curve etc. as well as color palette selection. Here are some results found online:

**React** one of the most popular frontend frameworks among Angular and Vue, was developed by Facebook and has gained popularity over the last few years. **Material UI** was chosen as the user interface framework that follows the principle of material design, created by Google.

| Learning Curve | Steep learning curve, requires to lean associated concepts, i.e., TypeScript and MVC. | Medium learning curve. Not a complete framework and advanced features require the use of 3rd party libraries | Easiest learning curve. Provides higher customazability and has an overlap with Angular and React with respect to functionalities. |
| Size           | Depends on bundle size                                                                | 116 KB                                                                                                       | 91 KB                                                                                                                              |

[Shaumik](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/angular-vs-vue-vs-react/) wrote an article about Vue, Angular and React and the main takeaways are as follow:

- _Angular_ is the most mature framework, a complete package but has a steep learning curve. Angular is suitable for companies with large teams and developers who already use TypeScript.
- _React_ has a large number of contributions from the community and has gained widespread acceptance. It is a good choice for developers who like some flexibility in terms of integrating with other frameworks seamlessly.
- _Vue_ is the newest and remains to be seen how it does in the future. Vue should be the developer's choice if he prefers simplicity, but also simplicity.
